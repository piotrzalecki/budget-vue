Ticket — “Transactions page integration”

(Epic 4 – CRUD Endpoints)

This ticket stitches together everything you’ve built so far (router, Pinia store, TransactionTable, and the form drawer) into a fully-functional TransactionsPage.vue. After it’s done, you’ll be able to open the page, filter a date range, add/edit/delete rows, and see the table update instantly.

1  Responsibilities of the page

Area	What it must do	UI element
Data fetch	Ask the transactions Pinia store for rows when the page loads and whenever filters change.	lifecycle hook / watch
Filters	Date-range (2 pickers or a preset “This Month”), multi-tag select, text search on note.	Small toolbar above table
Table	Render via <TransactionTable>; pass props items, loading, page, itemsPerPage, total; handle edit, delete, page-change emits.	Already implemented component
Add / edit	Floating Action Button (FAB) ↗ opens TransactionFormDrawer; edit event from table opens the same drawer in edit mode.	<v-btn icon="mdi-plus">
Soft-delete	Confirmation dialog → invoke transactions.softDelete(id) → toast on success.	<ConfirmDialog>
Snackbar	Any success / error goes through useSnackbar().	Bottom overlay
Pagination	For now client-side; table displays Vuetify paginator.	Provided by v-data-table
Loading state	Show table’s built-in progress and/or a global linear bar while fetch in flight.	loading prop
